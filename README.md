#Instructions for running the game:
Here are the instructions for running the Hangman game:

1. *Open a Python environment*: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (python.org) if you haven't already.

2. *Copy the code*: Copy the entire code provided in the previous messages. This code contains the Hangman game implementation in Python.

3. *Open a text editor*: Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. You can use editors like Notepad, Sublime Text, or IDEs like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, etc.

4. *Paste the code*: Paste the copied code into a new file in the text editor.

5. *Save the file*: Save the file with a .py extension. You can choose any name for the file, for example, hangman_game.py.

6. *Run the script*: Open a command prompt or terminal window. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file using the cd command.

7. *Execute the script*: Type python hangman_game.py and press Enter. This command will run the Hangman game script.

8. *Follow the prompts*: Once the game starts, follow the prompts on the screen. Choose the difficulty level, guess letters to uncover the hidden word, and try to solve the puzzle within the given attempts.

9. *Play again*: After completing a round, you'll be asked if you want to play again. Type 'yes' to play another round or 'no' to exit the game.

10. *Enjoy the game*: Have fun playing Hangman and try to achieve the highest score possible!

That's it! You've successfully run the Hangman game. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!


Additional features or notes.
In the version 1.2 we have added some additional features are as follows:
The Hangman game implemented using Tkinter incorporates several additional features compared to the previous code:

1. *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*: This version of the game provides a graphical user interface using Tkinter, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing compared to the command-line interface in the previous code.

2. *Input Validation*: The game validates user input to ensure that only single alphabetical characters are accepted as guesses. If the input is invalid, an appropriate message is displayed.

3. *Categories for Words*: This version allows players to guess words from different categories such as countries, fruits, flags, and capitals. Each category contains a predefined list of words, adding variety to the gameplay.

4. *Instructions*: The game includes an option to display instructions, providing players with guidance on how to play.

5. *End Game Messages*: When the game ends, whether due to successful guessing or running out of attempts, appropriate messages are displayed to inform the player of the outcome.

6. *New Game Button*: Players can start a new game at any time by clicking the "New Game" button, providing flexibility and convenience.

These additional features enhance the overall gaming experience and make the Hangman game more enjoyable for players.
